<p>
Amateur is a free clone of Apple's QuickTime Player implemented in Swing using QuickTime for Java. However it is uncrippled and does not require registration or a serial number to provide full functionality.
</p>


<h2>Binaries</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amateur.dev.java.net/files/documents/3537/17270/Amateur.dmg">Mac 
OS X disk image</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
No tests have been done on Windows, and no binaries are available for that platform.
The source code can probably be ported to Windows with a few hours effort.
However, QuickTime and QuickTime for Java
would need to be 
installed on the Windows box. It is not included here. (It is bundled with 
various versions of Mac OS X)
</p>

<p>
A Linux port would be much more difficult since Apple does not publish QuickTime for 
Linux. Possibly you could do something with the Java Media Framework instead. 
</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>
Please use the <a href="https://amateur.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a> 
here on java.net to submit RFEs. bugs, etc.
</p>

<p>
You can also use e Issue Tracker to submit patches. Please be as clear as possible about what the patch does and why it does it.

If you want to participate in a project (especially one of mine, but I suspect this is true in general)
it is not enough to click the button and select the box for "Project Developer." 
If you do that, all I see is a message that "user <i>username</i> has requested the Developer role in the amateur project."
(Honestly this is a design flaw in the Collabnet system java.net is built on top of. 
When rejecting such a request I'm asked to give a reason, but 
when making the request the user can't give a reason or even their real name or e-mail address.)
I'll approve anonymous observer requests, but the chance of getting CVS commit access this way is virtually zero. 
Before you request a role, you need to communicate with me: send me e-mail, tell me who you are, 
what you want to do, why you need the role, send in some patches, participate in the mailing lists, etc. 
However, there's no way I'm granting write access to effectively anonymous individuals.
