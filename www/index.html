<p>
Amateur is a free clone of Apple's QuickTime Player implemented in Swing using QuickTime for Java. However it is uncrippled and does not require registration or a serial number to provide full functionality.

<h2>Binaries</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amateur.dev.java.net/files/documents/3537/17270/Amateur.dmg">Mac 
OS X disk image</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
No tests have been done on Windows, and no binaries are available for that platform.
The source code can probably be ported to Windows with a few hours effort.
However, QuickTme and QuickTime for Java
would need to be 
installed on the Windows box. It is not included here. (It is bundled with 
various versions of Mac OS X)
</p>

<p>
A Linux port would be much more difficult since Apple does not publish QuickTime for 
Linux. Possibly you could do something with the Java Media Framework instead.
