Amateur 1.1, 10/2010
--------------------

In contrast to earlier releases -which were prepared by Elliotte Harold-,
this release is by Ulf Dittmer, so that's who you should contact with any questions.

Features
--------

- added "Save As AIFF" and "Save as WAV" menus (AIFF can be imported into iTunes) 
- user preferences, as well as the list of recent files, are now stored between app invocations
  using the Preferences API
- added option to use AWT FileDialog instead of Swing JFileChooser (works much better on OS X)
- open info windows are updated with the current time, movie size and FPS during playback
- support playback of non-editable movies like QTVR
- works on Windows as well as OS X (other platforms are no-go because of the reliance on QT4J)

Code maintenance
----------------

- phased out use of deprecated method, and incorporated a number of FindBugs suggestions
- refactored the code to compile and run on Windows as well as OS X
- Java 5 is now required; started adding @Override annotations and using generics
- updated to newer version of browser launch code
- x86_64 architecture code is removed at build time, since QT4J doesn't support it

Running on Windows
------------------

If double-clicking the jar file does not work, try running the application from the command line like so:

java -cp Amateur-1.1.jar -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==AllPermission.policy com.elharo.quicktime.Main

or execute the Amateur.bat file by typing "Amateur" on the command line.

Although a desktop application should have all the permissions it needs, QT4J apparently needs them given explicitly.
